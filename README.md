Utilitarianism: This theory is used to determine the best decision that can be made which benefits society rather than individually. It is also known as consequential theory as under this an individual identifies all the participating individuals(stakeholders) who will get affected by the decision and what alternate actions can be taken. 

Deontology: In this, the focus is on abstract principles like honesty, fairness, respect, justice, etc. irrespective of the consequences one has to endure due to the decision made. Due to this reason, it is also called a non-consequentialist theory.

Virtue Ethics: Here, an individual wants to help others because is kind but not to get an outcome that leaves a positive impression on others in order to make them feel like they owe him or simply doing his job. An individual here considers character, motivations, and intentions.
